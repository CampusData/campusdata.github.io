*Our Mission: Planting the Campus Data flag*

### Different Website Concepts

###### Publicity
- Let people know we exist / that we are doing this at our schools
- Showcase effective examples of Open Data (on campuses or otherwise)

###### Dialogue about Campus Data
- We are starting a dialogue with others
- Allow other members to contribute content to the site, and allow people to see what others are doing
- People from other schools submit content through a form

###### Boilerplate / Quick Start Resources
- Provide raw template code / action plans that can be used to demonstrate to local admin the value of open data
- Write tutorials to make it easy for beginning programmers to get excited about working with APIs

### Site Goals
1. Convey our mission
2. Who's involved
3. How to join the community
4. Examples of success
	- Stories of impact
	- APIs
5. Links to resources (largely non-technical)
6. Education / contribution
7. Inspire people to read the guide

### Problems we are trying to solve
1. People don't know they can make an impact
2. People don't know others are thinking about this issue
	- Students (chief focus)
	- University administrators
3. Students aren't aware of the open data efforts happening at their schools

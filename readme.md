====================
*Our Mission: Planting the Campus Data flag*

###Different Website Concepts

######Publicity
- Let people know we exist / that we are doing this at our schools

######Dialouge about Campus Data
- We are starting a dialouge with others
- Allow other members to contribute content to the site, and allow people to see what others are doing
- People from other schools would submit content through a form.

###Site Goals
1. Convey our mission
2. Who's involved
3. How to join the community
4. Examples of Success
	- stories of impact
	- APIs
5. Links to resources (Largely non-technical)
6. Education / Contribution
7. Inspire people to read the guide

###Problems we are trying to solve
1. Poeple don't know they can make an impact
2. Poeple don't know others are thinkoing about this issue
	- Students (Cheif focus)
	- Universtiy Administrators
3. Students aren't aware of the OpenData efforts happening at their schools
	
###Ways to join the community
